This is a preliminary information. The tool Java2Vhdl translator is in progress.

== Approach

See link:Java2Vhdl_Approach.html[].

This document contains details of implementation of the translator. 



== How to translate in VHDL

Of course, an approach as "__evalating the source code with regular expression__" in any proper language
is not sufficient for translation of this Java code into VHDL. 
Only a complete parsing of the Java code with the known Java language syntax
and the synthesis of the VHDL code from the parsed data is sufficient. 

For parsing Java the __ZBNF__ parser is used. The '__Z__' means __semantic__ as reversed '__S__'
because the parse result is presented in the output immediately semantically prepared.
This simplifies the generation of VHDL. 
The __ZBNF__ parser was developed by the author himself in ~2007, frequently used 
for different approaches, see also link:../../../Java/html/RWTrans/ZbnfParser.html[].

== How does the parser work

The parser uses a textual script which is firstly prepared for internal use.
Due to this script the parser checks all paths which are given by the syntax.
This is a repeated recursively operation, which needs a longer time than a formally separation of syntax elements,
but the semantic is immediately clarified while parsing. 

Generally, also another parser may be sufficient to use. But the disadvantage of the longer parsing time is less important for this application.
It may be a further development in future.

You can look to the working of the parser with some options of the Java2Vhdl conversion, see java cmd line of the execution:

----
-parseData ... optional, if given, writes the parser java data tree
-pd ... optional, same as -parseData
-parseResult ... optional, if given, writes the parser result
-pr ... optional, same as -parseResult
-parseLog ... optional only with -parseResult, writes an elaborately parser log file
-pl ... optional, same as -parseLog
-tmp:path/to/dirTmp for log and result
---- 

* The `-parseData` option shows the prepared Java data which are used as input for the VHDL generation. 
It prepares a html file which shows a tree of all data. 
Any complex instance is presented with its [J]`toString()` output which may contain sometimes a "TODO".
Any basic instance, String and primitive variables, is shown with the data content. 
Any other parser may produce similar data, then the generator is usable without adaption.

* The `-parseResult` option presents the original parse result tree from the syntax file before post preparation

* The `-parseLog` shows an elaborately log how the parser is working.

Generally most all constructs in Java are well parsed, but on the other hand the kind of writing sources can be seen as limited
for the hardware FPGA description. It means the parser is not intent to parse all Java syntax with all newest Java features.

You can have a look to the syntax file. It is contained as textual file in the jar archive 
in the package `org.vishia.java2Vhdl.parseJava.JavaSyntax.zbnf`.

 
== Output preparation

For some outputs (TODO more) the link:../../../Java/docuSrcJava_vishiaBase/org/vishia/util/OutTextPreparer.html[org.vishia.util.OutTextPreparer] is used.
This class reads a textual file with the text to output with place holder.
They can be used to coordinate the appearance of the output in details.

The textual file for the output appearance is stored in jar file in the package path `org.vishia.java2Vhdl.VhdlTemplate.txt`



== Converting of an expression

The expression parsed from Java follows the approach described in
link:../../../Java/html/RWTrans/Calculator_RPN.html[Java/html/RWTrans/Calculator_RPN.html]. 
It means the parsed expression is supplied as Reverse Polish Notation in prepared execute order.
This allows to build the expression in VHDL to the VHDL precedence rules of the operators, independent of the Java ones.
General the back conversion to a infix notation from RPN is described also in the link above.

The problematic for VHDL source code generation is the necessary distinguish between boolean and the SIGNAL types.
See link:Java2Vhdl.html#boolIf[Java2Vhdl, chapter boolean expression and SIGNAL types with view to VHDL].

=== General algorithm to prepare the VHDL expression

The `genExpression(...)` is called whenever an expression is expected in the translated code. 
That is as statement (can be an assignment) or also as condition in `if`.

include::../../../main/java/srcJava_vishiaVhdlConv/org/vishia/java2Vhdl/VhdlConv.java[tag=genExpressionHead]
----

With the last shown `for` the `ExprPart` from the expression are processed in order of the RPN. 
The order of operands is the order in the original Java source.
But the operations are sorted to stack operations and active operations.

----

* If one `ExprPart` is a start of a new term, then the current content is pushed into a Stack for further usage.
Now firstly this term is prepared straight forward.
* If the __accumulator__ should be used as following argument, then this is the currently prepared term,
used now right side. The left side term is popped from stack. The part does not contain an operand, 
because even, it is the __accumulator__, the till now prepared term used as operand. 
* Either the `exprRight` or the operand in the `part` is used for the operation which is added to `exprLeft`.
* If the operator is an assignment, this needs special handling. 
An assignment can also be a part in the expression, in form `y = a & ( x = c | d) ^ e;`.
Then first the inner assignment is generated: `x = c | d;` as extra statement. 
The assign-variable `x` remains in the `exprLeft`, so the outer assignment is executed furthermore with
`y = a & x ^ e`.

The following example should demonstrate the stack push and pop.

The original term is: 

 y = a | b & c;
 
The RPN form is:

 @y; @a; @b; &c; |@; =@;
 
It means 

* `y` is taken and stored. 
* `a` is taken and stored.
* `b` is taken, combined with with `& c` which produces `b AND c`.
* `|@` means, the stored term should be combined with the current term (__accu__).
** It means `b AND c` is the accu, used as right part of the term, 
** it is wrapped with `( )` because it is prior in execution and has not a higher precedence in VHDL.
** `a` is popped from stack, it is now the `leftExpr`
** The expression is built with the operator and the `rightExpr` as `a OR (b AND c)`
* `=@` means, the stored term should be combined with the current term (__accu__).
** The __accu__ contains `a OR (b AND c)`, used as right part of the term.
** Because it is an assignment, the `genAssignment(...)` is called.
** This produces as new line `y <= a OR (b AND c)`.

The necessary parenthesis arround the `AND` term are produced for VHDL 
because `AND` has not a higher precedence as `OR` in VHDL, but it is produced as unit before (__accu__),
hence should be wrapped. In Java `&` has a higher precedence in comparison to `|`. 
That's why the stack operation is used.
